# RavenNucleon
Automated Arch/ ArchArm Linux installer, for those of us who want to
install things quickly for the 1000th time. It is highly recommended that
if this is your first installation of Arch Linux that you install it manually
first, so that you get to grips with the system, such that you are better
equipped to solve any of the issues that ol' Archie can throw your way.

## Getting St4rt3d
Currentley this is not on the AUR or any pacage manager (pacman4life), after this project is
working as expected it will have a nicer installation process. For now, simply
download and run the following, which will guide you further:

```
python nucleon.py
```

Nucleon is fairly simple to operate based on its '-h'/ '--help' arguments. Some examples follow in section 'Example Usage'
